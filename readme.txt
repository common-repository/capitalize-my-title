This plugin allows you to automatically capitalize your titles in Title Case and sentence case with .

== Description ==

This plugin allows users to capitalize their headings using proper style rules. Automatically capitalize your titles in Title Case, AP style, APA style, Chicago style, MLA style, and more.

## SEE SUGGESTED CAPITALIZATION IN YOUR POST OR PAGE
See suggested capitalization within your post so you don’t need to get distracted from your writing. Override headings which are quite capitalized correctly. **The free version only provides recommendations for and capitalizes the main title of your post (title tags).**

The plugin pulls from the Capitalize My Title API so you always have the most up-to-date capitalization rules.

**Want recommendations for all of your headings instead of just the title? ** [Get the Premium version of our plugin.](https://plugin.capitalizemytitle.com) to get a much more automated experience.

## SET CUSTOM CAPITALIZATION RULES FOR DIFFERENT HEADERS
Want to use title case for your titles? You can! Want to have all of your titles in lowercase? You can! Configure individual styles and substyles per heading. It’s as easier as selecting them from the dropdown. With our [Premium plugin](https://plugin.capitalizemytitle.com) you can even set individual styles of different headers.

## WORKS WITH GUTENBERG AND PAGE BUILDERS
Our plugin works in Gutenberg and with many other page building plugins (including Generate Blocks, WPBakery Page Builder, etc.).

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS TO CREATE HEADINGS IN GUTENBERG
You can now create headings in Gutenberg using two methods of shortcuts. This brings back functionality from the Classic Editor that was lost with the release of the Block Editor (also called Gutenberg).

To change the heading size of a block or to convert a paragraph to a heading, select the block and use the following shortcuts:

To change to H1 heading: **SHIFT + ALT + 1**
To change to H2 heading: **SHIFT + ALT + 2**
To change to H3 heading: **SHIFT + ALT + 3**
To change to H4 heading: **SHIFT + ALT + 4**
To change to H5 heading: **SHIFT + ALT + 5**
To change to H6 heading: **SHIFT + ALT + 6**

To create a new heading with a specific heading size (versus the default H2):

Press ENTER then /h1 to create an H1 heading
Press ENTER then /h2 to create an H2 heading
Press ENTER then /h3 to create an H3 heading
Press ENTER then /h4 to create an H4 heading
Press ENTER then /h5 to create an H5 heading
Press ENTER then /h6 to create an H6  heading
